# DSCI 632 Final Project
The scope of this project is a Udemy dataset analysis, with Udemy being one of the largest platforms for online learning globally. Udemy is a (MOOC) platform with over fifteen thousand courses and forty million students. In this dataset we will analyze four different types of subject-courses offered in Udemy, including, web-development, business finance, musical instruments, and graphical design. Within Udemy both paid and unpaid courses are offered, thus we will choose to explore the popularity of courses surrounding paid subscription or unpaid, as well as level of popularity based on the number of enrolled students, instructor reviews, and content durations.
